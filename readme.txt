Model of recurrent cyclic inhibition as described on p.119 of Friesen and
Friesen (1994), which was slightly modified from Szekely's model (1965).
The conditions for oscillation are:
(1) the loop must contain an odd number of neurons,
(2) each of which can significantly inhibit its target,
and (3) the excitatory drive must be strong enough so the
   loop neurons will spike when released from inhibition
 
In the SpikePlot, the bottom three trains show the alternating activity of
the loop neurons.  The top three trains are the afferent excitatory streams.
